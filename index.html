                <article>
                    <p>This is a project set out by Codecademy, to allow the student to consolidate the knowledge that
                        has been taught so far.
                        By creating a website that tabulates a list of html and css styles. </p>
                    <p>For the most part, this is an un-guided project with only a few tips provided by the company on
                        what needs to be included.</p>

                <h2>My Own Experience</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>My knowedge of HTML/CSS was limited before starting the Codecademy course. I knew basic structure
                        and some elements from my job but not enough to go about creating my own site from scratch.</p>
                    <p>Bar a few pieces of information, this site has been created on the back of the knowledge obtained
                        from this course.</p>
